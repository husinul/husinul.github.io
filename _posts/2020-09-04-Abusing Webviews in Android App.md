Android developers frequently use WebViews to incorporate web features into their applications. Normally, when developers use WebViews the default settings are used. Unfortunately, some Application made a number of WebView changes that facilitated attacks against its users. Letâ€™s start off by finding the WebView changes made by some of these Apps.

### Observation
During My bug hunting days i was observed some 3rd party sdk's WebViewActivity is vulnerable to open redirect, XSS, Javascript Injection and it doesn't validate data pass to intent.

It means that it can be accessed by any third-party apps installed on the same device. On the newest Androids it also could be exploited by Android Instant Apps directly from a web-browser

##### Open Redirection

.

In file we can see that it opens attacker provided URLs. There is no validation on the url being passed to this activity and it can open any malicious url and present content to the user.
