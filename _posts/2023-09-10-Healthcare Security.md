##### Risk

An attacker can get sensitive information about the Internal Employees, and this might lead to further attacks  

##### Risk Mitigation

It is recommended to implement adequate access controls (authentication and authorization) to manage and limit access to all restricted URLs, functions, scripts or files. It should be ensured that authenticated users have access to only those functions and data they are authorized to access. These controls should be implemented at the server side
